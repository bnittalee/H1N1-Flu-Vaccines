# Developing and Comparing Machine Learning Models for Predicting Vaccine Distribution Likelihood
By Brittney Nitta-Lee

# Business and Data Understanding
The National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) conducted a National 2009 H1N1 Flu Survey which was sponsored by the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. The one-time survey was a list-assisted random-digit-dialing telephone survey of households. The survey was designed to monitor influenza immunization coverage in the 2009 to 2010 season.

# Survey respondents
The target population was persons 6 months or older living in the United States. The data includes surveys from more than 26,000 people.

# Overview
I aim to develop and compare three distinct machine learning models, namely Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, and Random Forest Classifier, to predict individuals' likelihood of receiving a vaccine. The project will involve preprocessing the dataset, training and tuning the models, and evaluating their performance using appropriate metrics to identify the most effective approach for vaccine distribution prediction.
